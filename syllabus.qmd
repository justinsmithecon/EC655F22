## Course Description

This first course in econometrics at the graduate level will build on the knowledge you gained in your undergraduate econometrics classes. Some of the topics we cover will be advanced versions of things you already know, while others will be completely new. The goal is to build a foundation in economic statistics for those who want pursue a career in data analysis and also those who will continue to study economics at the PhD level. While the course will cover both theoretical and empirical aspects of econometrics, it will have an applied focus. What this means operationally is that assignments and exams are geared towards applying your knowledge to real world economic situations, estimating models using data, and discussing model intuition.

## Lectures

The scheduling details of the course are as follows

| Section |       Time       | Location |

### Software

All assignments require you to manipulate data using the statistical software R alongside a user interface called R Studio. The assignments are also required to be written in Quarto, which is intergrated with R Studio.  All of these programs are free, and available on all computer platforms. You can use R without R Studio, but I would only recommend this is you have prior experience with the program or have a computer programming background. I will give instructions on how to access these materials in class.

## Evaluation

You will be evaluated on three equally weighted assignments, one midterm, and one final exam. The weights and due dates for each assessment are as follows:

| Assessment   | Due Date                              | Weight |
|:-------------|:--------------------------------------|:-------|
| Assignment 1 | Friday, October 6, 2023 at 9:00pm     | 16.67% |
| Assignment 2 | Friday, November 3, 2023 at 9:00pm    | 16.67% |
| Midterm      | Wednesday, November 8, 2023, in class | 20%    |
| Assignment 3 | Friday December 1, 2023 at 12:00pm    | 16.67% |
| Final Exam   | TBA                                   | 25%   |
| Competition  | Ongoing                               | 5%*   |


Assignments will ask you to manipulate and interpret data using the statistical software R. Instructions will be posted to MLS at least one week prior to the due date.

Both the midterm and final exam will be in person. The midterm will take place in the classroom where the lectures take place at the scheduled lecture time. The final exam schedule is posted roughly half way through the term.

*The Department of Economics is running a prediction competition through the 2023-24 school year (details given in class).  Students who sign up a team, and participate in the competition will receive 5% of their grade.  For those who do not participate, the weight shifts automatically to the final exam, which will be worth 30%.


## Topics

Below is a list of tentative topics covered in the course. I may add or remove items depending on how quickly the course proceeds. A reading list for each topic is available at the end of this syllabus.

1.  Introduction to R

2.  Review of Matrix Algebra for Econometrics

3.  Conditional Expecations, Linear Regression, and OLS

4.  Causal Inference

5.  Panel Data Methods

6.  Qualitative Dependent Variable Models

7.  Additional Topics


## Missed Midterms

Students who miss a midterm will be given reasonable accommodation for the following reasons:

1)  [Religious conflict]{.underline}: If you have a religious commitment
    that interferes with the midterm exam, university policy is that
    **you must alert me within the first two weeks of the start of
    the term** and fill out the [Student Request for Accommodation for
    Religious Observances form](https://web.wlu.ca/accommodations/). If
    those conditions are met, we will work together to provide a
    reasonable accommodation.

2)  [Course conflict]{.underline}: If your midterm overlaps with another
    scheduled course, please inform me as soon as you know about the
    conflict and we will work out a reasonable accommodation.

3)  [Varsity Sports]{.underline}: If a varsity sporting event interferes
    with the midterm, you must contact your coach, who will arrange for
    an alternative time to write the test. Note that this policy applies
    only to *varsity* sports; students who have non-varsity sports
    conflicts are not eligible for a deferred midterm

Students who miss a midterm and have an acceptable medical or compassionate reason will have the weight of the midterm transferred to the final exam. In the case of medical reasons, I require that students complete the [Absence for Medical Reasons Self-Declaration Form](https://web.wlu.ca/illness/).

In all other circumstances, students who miss a midterm will receive a grade of zero on the test.

## Late Assignments

Late assignments and quizzes for religious conflicts, course conflicts, or medical/compassionate reasons as defined above will be given reasonable accommodation. In all other circumstances, students who submit late assignments or quizzes will receive a grade of zero.

## Deferred Final Examinations

Students who miss a final examination can submit a petition to the Faculty of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies for a deferred exam. Students who miss the exam due to illness must submit the petition no later than 5 days after the missed exam with original supporting documentation. Students requesting a deferred exam for reasons other than personal illness or bereavement must submit a petition at the time of the exam schedule posting to allow the committee to reach a decision before the scheduled date.

Students are strongly urged not to make any commitments (e.g., vacation) during the examination period. Students are required to be available for examinations during the examination periods of all terms in which they register. Refer to the Handbook on Undergraduate Course Management for more information.

## Academic Integrity

You are reminded that the University will levy sanctions on students who are found to have committed, or have attempted to commit, acts of academic or research misconduct. You are expected to know what constitutes an academic offense, to avoid committing such offenses, and to take responsibility for your academic actions. For information on categories of offenses and types of penalty, please consult the relevant section of the Undergraduate Academic Calendar. If you need clarification of aspects of University policy on Academic and Research Misconduct, please consult your instructor.
