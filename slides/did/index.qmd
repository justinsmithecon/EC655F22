## Introduction

-   Uses a natural experiment to separate data into treatment and control groups

    -   A policy or naturally occurring event that creates exogenous variation in a variable

        -   Ex: Increasing the minimum wage in one state but not another

        -   Ex: Mandated fitness policies in some schools but not others

-   Usually data in the form of pooled cross-sections

    -   Individuals in 2 (or more) time periods

    -   Could be same or different people in each time period

-   Can also have data in 2 groups in same time period

    -   Individuals in 2 different states, countries

    -   People in 2 different schools

-   DiD is a specific way to compare treatment to control group

# Model

## Setup

-   Imagine the following scenario

    -   We have data on 2 groups of people (A, and B)

    -   We have data during 2 time periods (1 and 2)

    -   Group A was exposed to some treatment in period 2

        -   Ex: Minimum Wages (Card and Krueger (1994))

        -   Group A (New Jersey) increases their minimum wage in period 2

        -   Group B (Pennsylvania) does not change its minimum wage

        -   We observe both groups before and after the wage change

-   We want to measure the causal effect of the policy

## Potential Outcomes

-   We will couch this estimator in the potential outcomes framework

-   Recall that observed outcomes are $$y = (y_{1} - y_{0} )w +  y_{0}$$

    -   $y_{0}$ is outcome without treatment

    -   $y_{1}$ is outcome with treatment

-   Define the following dummy variables

    -   $dA = 1$ if in group A, 0 if in group B

    -   $d2 = 1$ of in time period 2, 0 if in period 1

-   $w$ is the binary treatment indicator

    -   Equals 1 for group A in period 2, and 0 otherwise

    -   It is equivalent to $dA \times d2$

## CEF

-   Take difference in observed outcome between treatment and control in period 2

$$E[y|dA = 1, d2 = 1] - E[y|dA = 0, d2 = 1]$$ $$ = E[y_1|dA = 1, d2 = 1] - E[y_0|dA = 0, d2 = 1]$$\
$$ = E[y_1|dA = 1, d2 = 1] - E[y_0|dA = 1, d2 = 1] $$ $$+ E[y_0|dA = 1, d2 = 1]- E[y_0|dA = 0, d2 = 1]$$

-   This is the ATT plus selection bias
-   Selection bias possibly not zero because $y_0$ different between groups A and B in period 2

## CEF

-   DiD subtracts the difference in outcomes from period 1 to account for selection

$$E[y|dA = 1, d2 = 1] - E[y|dA = 0, d2 = 1]$$ $$ -[E[y|dA = 1, d2 = 0] - E[y|dA = 0, d2 = 0]]$$ $$ = E[y_1|dA = 1, d2 = 1] - E[y_0|dA = 1, d2 = 1] $$ $$+ E[y_0|dA = 1, d2 = 1]- E[y_0|dA = 0, d2 = 1]$$ $$ -[E[y_0|dA = 1, d2 = 0] - E[y_0|dA = 0, d2 = 0]]$$

-   Selection bias is zero if we assume **constant bias** or **common trends**

## Constant Bias

-   Selection bias is zero if we make the **constant bias assumption**

-   From above

$$+ E[y_0|dA = 1, d2 = 1]- E[y_0|dA = 0, d2 = 1]$$ $$ -[E[y_0|dA = 1, d2 = 0] - E[y_0|dA = 0, d2 = 0]]$$

-   Constant bias means group difference in $y_0$ is the same in both time periods

    -   Between group differences in prior period are a good counterfactual for difference in treated time period

## Common Trends

-   An equivalent assumption is **common trends assumption**

-   Rearrange the selection bias term to be

$$+ E[y_0|dA = 1, d2 = 1]- E[y_0|dA = 1, d2 = 0]$$ $$ -[E[y_0|dA = 0, d2 = 1] - E[y_0|dA = 0, d2 = 0]]$$

-   Says trend in $y_0$ for group A is the same as group B

    -   Trend in group B is a good counterfactual for trend in group A

-   Both assumptions are equivalent and assume no selection bias

```

## Regression

-   We can model the CEF with a regression because it is a saturated model

$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 dA + \beta_2 d2 + \beta_3 (dA \times d2) + u$$

-   The parameter $\beta_3$ is the population difference in differences

$$\beta_3 = E[y|dA = 1, d2 = 1] - E[y|dA = 0, d2 = 1] $$ $$- E[y|dA = 1, d2 = 0]- E[y|dA = 0, d2 = 0 ]$$

-   Recall that $\beta_3$ is the ATT if we assume common trends or constant bias

    -   If those do not hold, we have selection bias

## Interpretation of DiD

-   Under the assumption of constant treatment effects, $\beta_{3} = ATE = ATT$

    -   Constant treatment effects means it is the same for all groups

-   If treatment effect can vary across groups, $\beta_{3} = ATT$

    -   Card and Krueger: $\beta_{3}$ is the effect of increase in minimum wage on employment in NJ

# Estimation

## Estimation

-   Estimation typically done by OLS $$y = \hat{\beta}_{0} + \hat{\beta}_{1}dA +\hat{\beta}_{2}d2 + \hat{\beta}_{3}(dA\times d2)+ u$$

-   The coefficient on $(dA\times d2)$ is the DiD estimator

-   It is given simply by $$\hat{\beta}_{3} = (\bar{y}_{A2} - \bar{y}_{B2}) - (\bar{y}_{A1} -\bar{y}_{B1})$$

-   You can also add control variables $$y= \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}dA +\beta_{2}d2 + \beta_{3}(dA\times d2)+\mathbf{x}\boldsymbol{\alpha}+ u$$

-   The interpretation remains similar, but estimator no longer collapses to the easy formula

# Extensions

## Multiple Treatments

-   Imagine the Card study where NJ raises the minimum wage

-   Suppose that NY also raises it $$y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}d(NJ,NY) +\beta_{2}d2 +\beta_{3}(d(NJ,NY)\times d2)+  u$$

-   $d(NJ,NY)$ equals 1 if in NJ or NY

-   This restricts the effect to be the same in NJ and NY

    -   Allowing for different impacts in NY and NJ

        $$y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}dNJ+\beta_{2}dNY +\beta_{3}d2 + \beta_{4}(dNJ\times d2)+ \beta_{5}(dNY\times d2)+ u$$

    -   Here, PA is used as the control group for both treatments

## Multiple Time Periods

-   Imagine again the Card study with only NJ and PA

-   Suppose we observe 4 time periods: 2 before, and 2 after policy change

-   The specification could change to $$y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}dNJ +\beta_{2}d2 +\beta_{3}d3 +\beta_{4}d4 + \beta_{5}(dNJ\times d(3,4))+u$$

-   where $d(3,4)$ is a dummy equal to 1 if time period is 3 or 4

-   This would impose that the treatment effect is the same in all years

-   A more general way to model this would be $$y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}dNJ +\beta_{2}d2 +\beta_{3}d3 +\beta_{4}d4 + \beta_{5}(dNJ\times d3)+ \beta_{6}(dNJ\times d4)+ u$$

    -   $\beta_{5}$ is the treatment effect in time period 3

    -   $\beta_{6}$ is the treatment effect in time period 4

## Multiple Treatments and Time Periods

-   In this most general case, the specification is $$y = \beta_{0} + \mathbf{dG}\boldsymbol{\beta_{1}} +\mathbf{dT}\boldsymbol{\beta_{2}}+\mathbf{z}\boldsymbol{\beta_{3}}+ u$$

-   Where

    -   $\mathbf{dG}$ is a set of group dummies

    -   $\mathbf{dT}$ is a set of time dummies

    -   $\mathbf{z}$ are interaction between the time and group dummies post treatment

    -   $\mathbf{z}$ could also be a scalar equal to 1 for all groups and time periods post treatment

-   This is sometimes called the **Two-Way Fixed Effects (TWFE)** model

## Checking Validity of DiD

-   Recall that a required assumption is common trends

-   You can check that empirically by looking at trends for treatment and control groups prior to treatment

    -   Requires more than 2 time periods

-   To do this, you can

    -   Estimate regression with sample before treatment

    -   Include time dummy variables, group variables, interactions

    -   Do F-test on interactions

# Problems with DiD

## Standard Errors

-   You must use "cluster-robust" standard errors

    -   Error is not iid across all individuals

    -   Common group component

    -   Must correct for this or SEs will be biased downward severely

-   Donald and Lang (2001)

    -   Clustered standard errors may not be enough

    -   Asymptotic results bad when number of groups is small

    -   Use bootstrap to solve this problem

        -   In particular the clustered wild bootstrap

## Standard Errors

-   Bertrand, Duflo, Mullainathan (2004)

    -   Errors may be serially correlated

    -   Only a problem when there are many time periods

    -   To fix, you can aggregate to 2 time periods

    -   Use a "block" bootstrap

## Timing of Treatment

-   You can have multiple groups who are treated at different times

-   DiD estimator is complicated weighted average of treatment and control pairs

-   Can be even more complicated if treatment effect varies over time

-   See [Roth et. al. (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407623001318) for an overview

# Difference in Difference in Differences

## Model

-   Sometimes even the DiD assumptions are not valid

    -   The common trend assumption is violated

-   Example: Health care policy aimed at elderly (Wooldridge (2007))

    -   Suppose we have two groups

        -   Elderly in state with policy

        -   Elderly in state without policy

        -   Both are observed in 2 time periods

    -   Could do DiD using difference in non-policy state as control

        -   This alternative state might evolve differently somehow

    -   Now, imagine in each state we have

        -   Elderly and non-elderly

        -   Both are observed in 2 time periods

## Model

-   Could do DiD in treatment state using difference in non-elderly as control group

    -   Health of elderly and non-elderly might evolve differently

-   With 2 potential DiDs, which one do we choose?

-   The DDD estimator is an extension of the DiD estimator

    -   Uses both DiDs in the same specification

    -   Uses controls from within the treatment state (non-elderly) and from the other state (non-policy state) simultaneously

## Model

-   Suppose we separate the sample into these groups

    -   Group A: People in treatment state

    -   Group B: People in control state

    -   Group E: Elderly

    -   Group N: Non Elderly

-   The regression would be $$y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}dA + \beta_{2}dE +\beta_{3}d2 + \beta_{3}(dA\times d2)$$ $$+ \beta_{4}(dE\times d2) + \beta_{5}(dE\times dA) + \beta_{6}(dE\times dA \times d2) 
        + u$$

## Estimation

-   The DDD estimator is $$\hat{\beta}_{6} = [(\bar{y}_{AE2} - \bar{y}_{AN2}) - (\bar{y}_{AE1} - \bar{y}_{AN1})]$$ $$- [(\bar{y}_{BE2} - \bar{y}_{BN2}) - (\bar{y}_{BE1} - \bar{y}_{BN1})]$$

-   Intuition

    -   Do a separate DiD in treatment and control state

    -   Subtract the 2 DiD estimates

        -   Uses one DiD as a control for the other

    -   There are actually several ways to interpret this estimator

-   The same problems with DiD apply to DDD estimators

    -   You must be careful with the standard errors

    -   You must be careful with the interpretation
