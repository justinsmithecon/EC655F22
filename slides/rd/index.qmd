# Introduction

## Introduction

-   RD is a popular method to identify causal treatment effects

-   The method mimics a randomized experiment

    -   People are assigned to treatment or not based on some known continuous variable

        -   Those above some "cutoff" are given the treatment

    -   Around the cutoff people share similar characteristics, except for the treatment

    -   Thus, looking at outcome differences for those just above cutoff compared to just below will reveal causal effect of treatment

-   It identifies a local LATE

    -   It is LATE in the sense we defined in instrumental variables

    -   Also, it focuses on people in the immediate vicinity of the discontinuity

## Example

-   Example: Milligan and Lemieux (2008)

    -   Effect of social assistance on employment

        -   Extra dollars of social assistance is the treatment

    -   Amount of social assistance determined by age

        -   Before 1989, 30+ year olds got roughly \$550 in monthly benefits

        -   Those under 30 got roughly \$200

        -   Treatment is getting more social assistance

    -   People around age 30 are roughly similar on average

    -   Compares employment rates for 30 year olds to those just under 30

        -   At the cutoff, the only difference between 2 groups is benefit level

    -   Reveals causal effect of getting more benefits on employment

    -   Results show more benefits means lower employment rates

# Sharp Regression Discontinuity

## Setup

-   RD is best understood visually

-   Suppose we have potential outcomes $y_{0}$ and $y_{1}$

    -   $y_{0}$ is the outcome if not treated

    -   $y_{1}$ is the outcome if treated

-   Both potential outcomes are continuous functions of some variable $S$

    -   $S$ is called the "running variable" or "forcing variable"

-   In the example paper, $S$ is age

    -   $y_{0}$ is employment rate with normal benefits

    -   $y_{1}$ is employment rate with extra benefits

-   Graph below plots example CEFs as a function of $S$

## CEF of Potential Outcomes

```{r echo = FALSE}
ggplot() +
  geom_function(fun = function(x) 2 + 5*x, color = "red", linetype='longdash', size = 1.5, alpha = .2) +
  geom_function(fun = function(x) 12 + 5*x, color = "red", linetype='longdash', size = 1.5, alpha = .2) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 5, linetype="dotted") +
  labs(x = "S", y = "y", title = "CEF of Linear Potential Outcomes") +
  theme_pander(nomargin = FALSE) +
  xlim(0,10) +
  annotate("text", x=8, y=38, label = "E[y0|s]") +
  annotate("text", x=3, y=30, label = "E[y1|s]") 

```

## Treatment Assignment

-   In RD, treatment is assigned based on the value of $S$ relative to a cutoff $\bar{S}$

-   In graph above suppose $\bar{S} = 5$

    -   Those with $S\ge \bar{S}$ get the treatment

    -   Those with $S< \bar{S}$ do not get the treatment

-   If the treatment variable is $w$ then

$$w = 1[S\ge \bar{S}]$$

-   In the example paper, $w$ is a dummy for getting extra benefits

    -   $\bar{S} = 30$ years old and $w=1$ happens when $S\ge 30$

## Observed Value of the Outcome

-   Recall that the observed outcome $y = y_{0} + (y_{1} - y_{0})w$

    -   $y = y_{0}$ if $w=0$, $y = y_{1}$ if $w=1$

-   Since $w = 1[S\ge \bar{S}]$ we can write

    -   $y = y_{0}$ if $S< \bar{S}$, $y = y_{1}$ if $S\ge \bar{S}$

-   We can then draw the CEF $E[y|S]$ on the graph

    -   Black line is the CEF of $E[y|S]$
    -   Red lines are the (unobserved) potential outcomes

## Observed Value of the Outcome

```{r echo = FALSE}
ggplot() +
  geom_function(fun = function(x) 2 + 5*x, color = "black", xlim=c(0,5),  size = 1.5) +
  geom_function(fun = function(x) 12 + 5*x, color = "red", xlim=c(0,5), linetype='longdash', size = 1.5, alpha = .2) +
  geom_function(fun = function(x) 2 + 5*x, color = "red", xlim=c(5,10), linetype='longdash', size = 1.5, alpha = .2) +
  geom_function(fun = function(x) 12 + 5*x, color = "black", xlim=c(5,10), size = 1.5) +  
  geom_vline(xintercept = 5, linetype="dotted") +
  labs(x = "S", y = "y", title = "CEFs and Observed Outcome") +
  theme_pander(nomargin = FALSE) +
  xlim(0,10) +
  annotate("text", x=8, y=55, label = "E[y|s]") +
  annotate("text", x=3, y=13, label = "E[y|s]") 
```

## Bias in Regression

-   Consider the population least squares regression of $y$ on $w$

$$y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}w + u $$

-   The slope in this regression is

$$E[y|w=1] - E[y|w=0]$$ $$=  E[y_{1} - y_{0}|w=1] + E[y_{0}|w=1]- E[y_{0}|w=0]$$

-   Selection bias does not disappear because $y_{0}$ is not independent of treatment

    -   The mean of $y_{0}$ above the cutoff is not the same as below the cutoff

    -   Example: untreated employment outcomes are different for older and younger people

## Conditional Mean Independence

-   What if we instead condition on $S$?

    $$E[y|S,w=1] - E[y|S,w=0]$$ $$=  E[y_{1} - y_{0}|S,w=1] + E[y_{0}|S,w=1]- E[y_{0}|S,w=0]$$

-   In this case, selection bias will disappear because treatment is determined by $S$

    -   So holding $S$ fixed, mean $y_{0}$ is independent of treatment

-   In our example, people of the same age have the same average untreated outcome

-   Because $E[y_{0}|S] = E[y_{0}|S, w]$ we can write

$$E[y|S,w=1] - E[y|S,w=0] =  E[y_{1} - y_{0}|S,w=1] $$

-   This is the ATT conditional on $S$

## Conditional Mean Independence

-   **Problem:** we cannot compute $E[y|S, w = 1] - E[y|S, w = 0]$

    -   Because $w=1$ only for those with $S\ge \bar{S}$

    -   And $w=0$ only for those with $S< \bar{S}$

-   There is no "overlap" in these functions

    -   No spot in the graph with two solid lines at a value of $S$

## Conditional Mean at Cutoff

-   RD solves this problem by focusing on the treatment cutoff

$$E[y|S = \bar{S}] - lim_{S\uparrow \bar{S}} E[y|S]$$ $$=  E[y_{1} - y_{0}|S = \bar{S}] +E[y_{0}|S = \bar{S}]- lim_{S\uparrow \bar{S}}E[y_{0}|S]$$

-   The key assumption is the that $E[y_{0}|S = \bar{S}]$ is continuous at $S=\bar{S}$

$$E[y_{0}|S = \bar{S}] = lim_{S\uparrow \bar{S}} E[y_{0}|S]$$

-   If this is true, selection bias disappears and we get the ATT at the cutoff

$$E[y|S = \bar{S}] - lim_{S\uparrow \bar{S}} E[y|S] =E[y_{1} -y_{0} |S = \bar{S}]$$

## Observed Value of the Outcome

```{r echo = FALSE}
ggplot() +
  geom_function(fun = function(x) 2 + 5*x, color = "black", xlim=c(0,5),  size = 1.5) +

  geom_segment(aes(x = 5, y = 27, xend = 5, yend = 37),color = "red",
                  arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.25, "cm"), ends="both"))+
  annotate("text", x=5.7, y=19, label = TeX("$\\E[y_{1} -y_{0} |S = \\bar{S}]$"))

```

## Conditional Mean at Cutoff

-   The idea behind these assumptions is

    -   Compare average observed outcome just above cutoff to average outcome just below

    -   They serve as good counterfactuals if potential outcomes not affected by treatment

    -   e.g. social assistance benefits and employment

        -   Compare mean employment rate for people just above and below age 30

        -   Works if employment rates smooth across age 30 without treatment

## Conditional Mean at Cutoff

-   We plotted CEFs of potential outcomes assuming they are linear with equal slopes

-   They do not have to be

-   The two graphs below present situations where

    -   Potential outcomes are linear with different slopes

    -   They are nonlinear

  annotate("text", x=5.7, y=8, label = TeX("$\\E[y_{1} -y_{0} |S = \\bar{S}]$"))

```

## Summary of Model

-   The key result is

$$E[y|S = \bar{S}] - lim_{S\uparrow \bar{S}} E[y|S] =E[y_{1} -y_{0} |S = \bar{S}]  $$

-   This works as long as $E[y_{0}|S = \bar{S}]$ is continuous at $S=\bar{S}$

-   Thus, RD estimates an average treatment effect **at the cutoff point**

-   As before, we do not know the conditional expectation, so we must estimate

-   There are various ways, but we will cover OLS regression

## Estimation

-   To estimate we need to approximate the function $E[y|S]$

-   We can use a population linear regression of $y$ on $S$, and estimate that by OLS

-   **Important**: we must allow for an intercept shift at the cutoff point $\bar{S}$

    -   This is the approximation of $E[y_{1} -y_{0} |S = \bar{S}]$

-   The simplest linear model is

$$y = \beta_{0} +  \beta_{1} S+\rho w + u$$

-   This is a straight line that jumps at $\bar{S}$ by $\rho$

## Linear Population Regression Function

  annotate("text", x=5.7, y=19, label = TeX("$\\rho$"))

```

## Estimation

-   To estimate the PRF, we can use OLS

-   Replace the population parameters with sample estimates

$$y = \hat{\beta}_{0} +  \hat{\beta}_{1} S+\hat{\rho} w + \hat{u}$$

-   The estimate of $\rho$ is the difference in predicted $y$ at the cutoff point

$$\hat{\rho} = (\hat{\beta}_{0} +  \hat{\beta}_{1} S+\hat{\rho}) -   (\hat{\beta}_{0} +  \hat{\beta}_{1} S)$$

## Estimation

-   A more complicated PRF allows the slope to differ on either side of the cutoff point

$$y = \beta_{0} +  \beta_{1} S+\rho w + \beta_{2}(S \times w) + u$$

-   The interaction term allows the slope to differ on either side of the cutoff point

$$\frac{\partial y}{\partial S} = \beta_{1} + \beta_{2} w$$

-   When $w = 1$ the slope changes by $\beta_{2}$

## Estimation

```{r echo = FALSE}
ggplot() +
  geom_function(fun = function(x) 2 + 5*x, color = "black", xlim=c(0,5),  size = 1.5) +
  geom_function(fun = function(x) 2 + 8*x, color = "black", xlim=c(5,10), size = 1.5) +  
  geom_vline(xintercept = 5, linetype="dotted") +
  labs(x = "S", y = "y", title = "PRF with Different Slopes") +
  theme_pander(nomargin = FALSE) +
  xlim(0,10) +
  annotate("text", x=8.5, y=60, label = TeX("$(\\beta_{0} +\\rho) +  (\\beta_{1}  + \\beta_{2}) S $")) +
  annotate("text", x=3, y=13, label = TeX("$\\beta_{0} +  \\beta_{1} S$")) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = 5, y = 28, xend = 5, yend = 41),color = "red",
                  arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.25, "cm"), ends="both"))
```

## Estimation

-   **Problem**: as specified, $\rho$ does not measure the jump at the cutoff

-   Call the prediction of $y$ at values of $S$ and $w$ $P[y|S, w]$

$$P[y|S, w=1] - P[y|S, w=0] $$ $$= (\beta_{0} +  \beta_{1} S+ \rho + \beta_{2}S) - (\beta_{0} +  \beta_{1} S) $$ $$= \rho +  \beta_{2} S $$

-   $\rho$ is therefore the jump when $S = 0$, not when $S=\bar{S}$

## Estimation

-   To ensure $\rho$ is the jump at the cutoff, we must center $S$ at the cutoff point

-   Define $S_{c} = S - \bar{S}$

-   Replace $S$ with $S_{c}$ in the PRF

$$y = \beta_{0}^{*} +  \beta_{1} S_{c}+\rho^{*} w + \beta_{2}(S_{c} \times w) + u$$

-   Difference in the PRF is now

$$P[y|S_{c}, w=1] - P[y|S_{c}, w=0] $$ $$= \rho^{*} +  \beta_{2} S_{c} $$

-   This occurs at the cutoff: $S_{c} = S - \bar{S}$ when $S = \bar{S}$

## Estimation

  annotate("text", x=5.7, y=19, label = TeX("$\\rho^{*}$"))
```

## Estimation

-   To estimate $\rho^{*}$ replace the population parameters with sample estimates

$$y = \hat{\beta}_{0}^{*} +  \hat{\beta}_{1} S_{c}+\hat{\rho}^{*} w + \hat{\beta}_{2}S_{c} \times w + \hat{u}$$

-   Prior to running OLS regression, ensure you create $S_{c} = S - \bar{S}$

-   $\hat{\rho}^{*}$ is the regression discontinuity estimate of the treatement effect

# Fuzzy Regression Discontinuity

## Setup

-   We still have potential outcomes $y_{0}$ and $y_{1}$ that are functions of $S$

-   Graph below plots their CEFs again as a function of $S$

-   The cutoff point is still $\bar{S}$

## CEF of Potential Outcomes

```{r echo = FALSE}
ggplot() +
  geom_function(fun = function(x) 2 + 5*x, color = "red", linetype='longdash', size = 1.5, alpha = .2) +
  geom_function(fun = function(x) 12 + 5*x, color = "red", linetype='longdash', size = 1.5, alpha = .2) +

  annotate("text", x=8, y=38, label = "E[y0|s]") +
  annotate("text", x=3, y=30, label = "E[y1|s]") 

```

## Treatment

-   The treatment is now only **partially** determined by $S$

    -   People are **assigned** to treatment if $S > \bar{S}$

    -   But they may not take it, so **actual** treatment could differ

-   Suppose that assignment to treatment is $z$

$$z = 1[S > \bar{S}]$$

-   Actual treatment is determined by $w$

$$w = w_{0} + (w_{1} - w_{0})z$$

-   The potential treatments are functions of $S$
-   The observed treatment is $w_{0}$ if $S \leq \bar{S}$ and $w_{1}$ if $S > \bar{S}$

## CEF of Treatment

  annotate("text", x=5.7, y=0.375, label = TeX("$\\E[w_{1} -w_{0} |S = \\bar{S}]$"))
```

## Observed Outcomes

-   Like before we can plot the CEF of the observed outcome

-   Unlike before

$$E[y|S \ge \bar{S}] \neq E[y_{1}|S \ge \bar{S}]$$ $$E[y|S < \bar{S}] \neq E[y_{0}|S < \bar{S}]$$

-   This is because actual treatment can deviate from assigned treatment

## Observed Outcomes

-   To find the CEF of the observed outcome remember

$$y = y_{0} + (y_{1} - y_{0})w$$

-   Rearrange

$$ y = y_{0}(1-w) + y_{1}w$$

-   Take expectations conditional on $S$

$$E[y|S] = E[y_{0}|S] (1-E[w|S]) + E[y_{1}|S]E[w|S]$$

## Treatment Effect

-   Computing the treatment effect is more complicated

-   It operates like the TSLS model we saw before

    -   $z$ is as an instrument for $w$

    -   Treatment effect is ratio of mean difference in $y$ to mean difference in $w$

-   The treatment effect is a LATE, at the cutoff

## Treatment Effect

-   Difference in CEF on each side of the cutoff

$$E[y|S = \bar{S}] - lim_{S\uparrow \bar{S}} E[y|S]$$

-   Replace $y$ with $y = y_{0} + (y_{1} - y_{0})w$

$$=  E[y_{0} + (y_{1} - y_{0})w|S = \bar{S}] - lim_{S\uparrow \bar{S}} E[y_{0} + (y_{1} - y_{0})w|S]$$

-   When $S \ge \bar{S}$ then $w = w_{1}$ and when $S < \bar{S}$ then $w = w_{0}$

$$=  E[y_{0} + (y_{1} - y_{0})w_{1}|S = \bar{S}] - lim_{S\uparrow \bar{S}} E[y_{0} + (y_{1} - y_{0})w_{0}|S]$$

## Model

-   Performing a bit of algebra, we get

$$=  E[(y_{1} - y_{0})(w_{1}-w_{0})|S = \bar{S}] + (E[y_{0}|S = \bar{S}] - lim_{S\uparrow \bar{S}} E[y_{0} |S] )$$

-   If $E[y_{0}|S = \bar{S}]$ is continuous at the cutoff, we can drop the second term

$$=  E[(y_{1} - y_{0})(w_{1}-w_{0})|S = \bar{S}] $$

  geom_segment(aes(x = 5, y = 27, xend = 5, yend = 30),color = "red",
                  arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.15, "cm"), ends="both"))+
  annotate("text", x=6.3, y=8, label = TeX("$\\E[(y_{1} -y_{0})(w_{1} -w_{0}) |S = \\bar{S}]$"))
```

## Model

-   If we make a monotonicity assumption (as we did in the LATE notes)

$$ E[(y_{1} - y_{0})(w_{1}-w_{0})|S = \bar{S}] = E[y_{1} - y_{0}|w_{1}-w_{0}=1,S = \bar{S}]  E[w_{1} - w_{0}|S = \bar{S}]$$

-   The CEF for $w$ is

$$E[w|S = \bar{S}] - lim_{S\uparrow \bar{S}} E[w|S] = E[w_{1} - w_{0}|S = \bar{S}] $$

-   Which brings us to

$$\frac{E[y|S = \bar{S}] - lim_{S\uparrow \bar{S}} E[y|S] }{E[w|S = \bar{S}] - lim_{S\uparrow \bar{S}} E[w|S] } = E[y_{1} - y_{0}|w_{1}-w_{0}=1,S = \bar{S}]$$

## Model

-   In the fuzzy RD we divide the mean difference in outcomes by the mean difference in treatment

    -   This "scales" the difference in outcomes by the difference in treatment probability

-   The interpretation is a LATE

    -   The treatment effect for compliers, at the cutoff

-   Just like sharp RD, you can allow different slopes, nonlinearities

## Estimation

-   Estimate using TSLS

    -   Treat $w$ as endogenous, and $z$ as an exogenous instrument

    -   $S$ is the included instrument

-   A linear structural model would be

$$y = \beta_{0} +  \beta_{1} S+\rho w + e$$

-   With first stage

$$w = \alpha_{0}  + \alpha_{1} S + \pi z + u$$

## Estimation

-   Estimating by TSLS the vector of coefficients is

$$\boldsymbol{\hat{\beta}}  = \left( \mathbf{\mathbf{\hat{X}}'\mathbf{\hat{X}}} \right)^{-1}\mathbf{\mathbf{\hat{X}}'y} =  
\begin{bmatrix}
\hat{\beta}_{0}\\
\hat{\beta}_{1}\\
\hat{\rho}
\end{bmatrix}$$

-   The $\hat{X}$ matrix contains the constant, $S$, and $\hat{w}$

-   As before you can add different slopes, nonlinearities

    -   Ensure you recenter the $S$ variable around the cutoff

## Internal Validity of RD

-   The treatment variable does not have to be binary

    -   See van der Klaauw (2001), Matsudaira (2008)

-   The method only works if the running variable $S$ cannot be manipulated

    -   Ex: Matsudaira (2008)

        -   Effect of summer school on future performance with 50% grade cutoff

        -   Kids may know the assignment rule to summer school

        -   Some more "motivated" kids put in effort to not attend

        -   Their non-treated outcomes differ on each side of the cutoff

        -   *i.e.* $E[y_{0}|S = \bar{S}] = lim_{S\uparrow \bar{S}} E[y_{0}|S]$

-   If running variable is manipulated in a non-random way, RD is invalid and biased

## Internal Validity of RD

-   Two ways to check if the running variable has been manipulated

    1.  Check for discontinuities in baseline variables

        -   Treatment is expected to be discontinuous; this is where our variation comes from

        -   However, near the discontinuity, *any other* variable must be continuous

        -   If we had covariates ($X$) determined *before* treatment, we could check to see if they have discontinuities 
        $$x=\gamma_{0} + \gamma_{1}S +  \delta z + u$$

        -   If $\delta \neq 0$, then this may signal a problem

    2.  Check for discontinuities in the density of the running variable

        -   A histogram may show "piling up" of people on one side of discontinuity

        -   If so, this may signal a problem

        -   See McCrary(2008) for more technical details

## External Validity of RD

-   External validity is the ability to extrapolate estimates

-   RD estimates are local to the cutoff

-   If there are heteogeneous treatment effects, may not be able to apply to whole population

    -   Ex: Estimates of benefits on employment for 30 year olds may not apply to 50 year olds
    -   Ex: Estimates of summer school on test scores for kids around 50% may not apply to high achievers

-   Must be careful not to overinterpret results
