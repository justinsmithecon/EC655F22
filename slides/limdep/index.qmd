## Introduction

-   Many economic outcomes are qualitative in nature

    -   Grouped into categories

        -   Work or not

        -   Drive, take bus, cycle to work

        -   Number of visits to Doctor

-   People sometimes use alternative methods in this context

    -   Though linear regression does still work in many cases

-   In this section we cover models for these types of variables

# Binary Choice Models

## Linear Probability Model

### Potential Outcomes

-   Start with the same potential outcomes setup

    -   $y_{1}$ is the outcome with treatment

    -   $y_{0}$ is the outcome without treatment

    -   $w$ is a binary variable with 1 denoting treatment, and 0 no treatment

-   We observe $(y, w)$, where

$$y = y_{0} + (y_{1} -y_{0})w$$

-   Key difference here is that $y_{1}$ and $y_{0}$ are binary

$$y_{0} \in \{0,1\}$$ $$y_{1} \in \{0,1\}$$

## Linear Probability Model

### Regression

-   The slope in a regression of $y$ on $w$ is

$$E(y|w=1) - E(y|w=0)$$ $$= \left [ E(y_{1}|w=1) - E(y_{0}|w=1) \right ] + E(y_{0}|w=1) - E(y_{0}|w=0)$$

-   First part is ATT, second part is selection bias

-   Mechanics are the same as when we had continuous outcomes

-   There is a difference in *interpretation*

-   $y$ is a Bernoulli random variable,

$$E(y|w) = 1 \times Pr(y=1|w) + 0 \times Pr(y=0|w) = Pr(y=1|w)$$

## Linear Probability Model

-   So you can restate the difference in observed means as

    $$Pr(y=1|w=1) - Pr(y=1|w=0)$$ $$= \left [ Pr(y_{1}=1|w=1) - Pr(y_{0}=1|w=1) \right ] + Pr(y_{0}=1|w=1) - Pr(y_{0}=1|w=0)$$

-   You can interpret as the difference in *response probabilities*

-   Difference in response probabilities is causal effect if

    -   Independence of potential outcomes

    -   Mean independence of potential outcomes

    -   Conditional mean independence of potential outcomes

## Linear Probability Model

-   What the above says is that regression still works when the treatment is binary

-   Causal effects depend on same assumptions as before

-   To estimate, use OLS regression of $y$ on $w$

-   When $y$ is binary, this is called the **Linear Probability Model**

## Linear Probability Model

### Issues with Linear Probability Model

-   Main problem is predicted probabilities can go outside \[0,1\] interval

    -   Some chance of nonesense probabilities

-   Mainly a problem of predictions

-   In most economic applications, we care about the slope

    -   So nonsense predictions are not a big problem

## Linear Probability Model

-   The model exhibits heteroskedasticity

-   The population least squares regression of $y$ on $w$ is

$$y = \beta_{0} +  w\beta_{1} + u$$

-   The conditional variance of the error is

$$Var[u|w] = Var[y|w] = E[y^2|w] - E[y|w]^2$$

-   Since $y$ is binary, $y^2 = y$, so

$$Var[y|w] = E[y|w] - E[y|w]^2$$

$$= E[y |w] (1-E[y|w])$$

## Linear Probability Model

-   Finally $E[y|w] = Pr(y=1|w)$, so

$$Var[u|w] = Pr(y=1|w) (1-Pr(y=1|w))$$

-   This means that the variance of the error term is a function of $w$

-   It introduces heteroskedasticity into the model

-   Solution: use heteroskedasticity robust standard errors

## Linear Probability Model

```{r}
  set.seed(1234)
  n <- 1000
  x <- rnorm(n)
  ystar <- 0.5 + 0.5*x + rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = .7)
  y <- ifelse(ystar > 0, 1, 0)
  dat <- data.frame(y,x)
  
  #Plot the data
  ggplot(dat, aes(x = x, y = y)) + 
    geom_point() + 
    stat_smooth(geom = "line", method="lm", color = "black", size = 1.5, alpha = .5, se = FALSE) +
    theme_pander() +
    annotate("text", x=-2, y=.5, label = "LPM") +
    geom_segment(aes(x = -2, y = .48, xend = -1.7, yend = .4), color = "black", arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.25, "cm"))) +
    labs(x = "x", y = "y", title = "Linear Probability Model") 

```

## Nonlinear Models

### Background

-   In some cases we may want to fix the predicted probability issue

    -   If you are doing prediction, for example

-   One way to do this is to feed the model through a CDF

-   This is often motivated with an index model

-   Suppose we model some latent variable $y^*$ as

$$y^* = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}w + e$$

-   It is some underlying continuous outcome driving our decisions

## Nonlinear Models

-   Issue is we do not observe $y^*$

-   Instead, we observe the binary $y$ where

$$y = 1\{y^*>0\}$$

-   Plugging the model into this

$$y = 1\{\beta_{0} + \beta_{1}w +e>0\}$$

-   The probability that $y=1$ is therefore

$$Pr(y=1|w) = Pr(\beta_{0} + \beta_{1}w +e>0 |w)$$

## Nonlinear Models

-   The random component is $e$, so rearrange to isolate it

$$Pr(y=1|w) = Pr(e > -\beta_{0} - \beta_{1}w |w)$$ $$ =1 -  F(-\beta_{0} - \beta_{1}w)$$ $$ =F(\beta_{0} + \beta_{1}w)$$

-   $F()$ is the probability distribution of $e$

    -   $1 - F(-\beta_{0} - \beta_{1}w) = F(\beta_{0} + \beta_{1}w)$ because $F()$ is symmetric

-   The probability that $y$ equals 1 depends on

    -   Treatment status $w$

    -   The distribution of $e$

-   Different choices for $F()$ distribution lead to different models

## Nonlinear Models

### Probit Model

-   Assuming $e \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^{2}_{e})$ leads to the **Probit Model**

$$Pr(y=1|w) = \Phi \left(\frac{\beta_{0} + \beta_{1}w}{\sigma^{2}_{e}} \right)$$

-   where

$$\Phi (z) =  \int_{-\infty}^{z} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{\frac{-v^2}{2}}\,dv$$

-   Because $\Phi(.)$ is a CDF, $Pr(y=1|w)$ is always between 0 and 1

    -   This solves the predicted probability problem

## Nonlinear Models

-   The difference in probabilities between treatment and control is

$$Pr(y=1|w = 1) - Pr(y=1|w=0)$$ $$=  \Phi \left(\frac{\beta_{0} + \beta_{1}}{\sigma^{2}_{e}} \right) - \Phi \left(\frac{\beta_{0}}{\sigma^{2}_{e}}  \right)$$

-   Notice that $\beta_{1}$ does [not]{.underline} equal the difference in response probabilities

    -   They are the slopes in the index model

    -   The index model parameters are not usually of interest

-   To get the difference in response probabilities, feed parameters into the CDF first

-   In nonlinear models, parameters are not "marginal effects"

    -   You need to separately compute them after estimating the model

## Nonlinear Models

-   In models with more variables and where they are continuous

$$Pr(y=1|\mathbf{x}) = \Phi \left(\frac{\mathbf{x}\boldsymbol{\beta}}{\sigma^{2}_{e}} \right)$$

-   The marginal effect for continuous variable $x_{j}$

$$\frac{\partial Pr(y=1|\mathbf{x})}{\partial x_{j}} = \phi \left(\frac{\mathbf{x}\boldsymbol{\beta}}{\sigma^{2}_{e}} \right) \frac{\beta_{j}}{\sigma^{2}_{e}}$$

-   This is a function of the entire vector $\mathbf{x}$

    -   You need to specify their values to get the marginal effect

    -   Normally people hold them at the mean

    -   In theory you can get a distribution of marginal effects

## Nonlinear Models

### Logit Model

-   Assuming $e \sim \text{Logistic}(0,\sigma^{2}_{e})$ leads to the **Logit Model**

$$Pr(y=1|w) = \Lambda \left(\frac{\beta_{0} + \beta_{1}w}{\sigma^{2}_{e}} \right)$$

-   where

    $$\Lambda (z) =  \frac{e^z}{1+e^z}$$

-   Again, because $\Lambda(.)$ is a CDF, $Pr(y=1|w)$ is always between 0 and 1

## Nonlinear Models

-   The observed difference in probabilities is

$$Pr(y=1|w = 1) - Pr(y=1|w=0)$$ $$=  \Lambda \left(\frac{\beta_{0} + \beta_{1}}{\sigma^{2}_{e}} \right) - \Lambda \left(\frac{\beta_{0}}{\sigma^{2}_{e}}  \right)$$

-   In models with more variables and where they are continuous

$$Pr(y=1|\mathbf{x}) = \Lambda \left(\frac{\mathbf{x}\boldsymbol{\beta}}{\sigma^{2}_{e}} \right)$$

## Nonlinear Models

-   The marginal effect for continuous variable $x_{j}$

$$\frac{\partial Pr(y=1|\mathbf{x})}{\partial x_{j}} = \Lambda \left(\frac{\mathbf{x}\boldsymbol{\beta}}{\sigma^{2}_{e}} \right) \left( 1-\Lambda \left(\frac{\mathbf{x}\boldsymbol{\beta}}{\sigma^{2}_{e}} \right) \right)\frac{\beta_{j}}{\sigma^{2}_{e}}$$

-   Again, this is a function of the full set of variables

## Nonlinear Models

### Estimation of Probit and Logit

-   Both models usually estimated by Maximum Likelihood

-   Method maximizes the probability of getting our sample by choosing parameters

    -   The**Likelihood Function** is the function of the parameters given the data

-   The probability distribution of $y_i$ is

$$f(y_i| \mathbf{x_{i}};\boldsymbol{\beta})= F \left(\frac{\mathbf{x_{i}}\boldsymbol{\beta}}{\sigma^{2}_{e}} \right)^{y_i} \left(1- F \left(\frac{\mathbf{x_{i}}\boldsymbol{\beta}}{\sigma^{2}_{e}} \right) \right) ^{1-y_{i}}$$

## Nonlinear Models

-   The joint probability of observing the all the $y_{i}$ in the data is

$$f(\mathbf{y}| \mathbf{X};\boldsymbol{\beta})=\Pi_{i=1}^n F \left(\frac{\mathbf{x_{i}}\boldsymbol{\beta}}{\sigma^{2}_{e}} \right)^{y_{i}}  \left(1- F \left(\frac{\mathbf{x_{i}}\boldsymbol{\beta}}{\sigma^{2}_{e}} \right) \right) ^{1-y_{i}}$$

-   The Likelihood Function recasts as a function of the parameters given the data

$$\mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\beta}|\mathbf{y}, \mathbf{X})=\Pi_{i=1}^n F \left(\frac{\mathbf{x_{i}}\boldsymbol{\beta}}{\sigma^{2}_{e}} \right)^{y_{i}}  \left(1- F \left(\frac{\mathbf{x_{i}}\boldsymbol{\beta}}{\sigma^{2}_{e}} \right) \right) ^{1-y_{i}}$$

## Nonlinear Models

-   Both models usually estimated by Maximum Likelihood

-   Method maximizes the joint probability of $y$ values conditional on $\mathbf{x}$

    -   This is called the **Likelihood Function**

-   In the case of a binary $y$, the likelihood function is

$$f[y| \mathbf{x};\boldsymbol{\beta}]=P[Y_{1} = y_{1}, Y_{2} = y_{2}, \ldots, Y_{n} = y_{n}|\mathbf{x_{i}};\boldsymbol{\beta}]$$ $$=\Pi_{y_{i}=1}F \left(\frac{\mathbf{x_{i}}\boldsymbol{\beta}}{\sigma^{2}_{e}} \right) \Pi_{y_{i}=0} \left[1-F \left(\frac{\mathbf{x_{i}}\boldsymbol{\beta}}{\sigma^{2}_{e}} \right) \right]$$ $$=\Pi_{i=1}^{n} F \left(\frac{\mathbf{x_{i}}\boldsymbol{\beta}}{\sigma^{2}_{e}} \right)^{y_{i}} \left[1-F \left(\frac{\mathbf{x_{i}}\boldsymbol{\beta}}{\sigma^{2}_{e}} \right)\right] ^{1-y_{i}}$$

## Nonlinear Models

-   Researchers usually focus on the log of the likelihood instead

    -   It is a monotonic (increasing) transformation of the likelihood

    -   The same parameter vector solves both versions

    -   Log likelihoods are easier to work with

-   Log Likelihood $$ln\mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\beta}|\mathbf{y}, \mathbf{X})= \sum_{i=1}^{N}\{ y_{i}lnF \left(\frac{\mathbf{x_{i}}\boldsymbol{\beta}}{\sigma^{2}_{e}} \right)+  (1-y_{i})ln (1-F \left(\frac{\mathbf{x_{i}}\boldsymbol{\beta}}{\sigma^{2}_{e}} \right))  \}$$

-   To solve this equation, you need numerical methods

    -   A grid search algorithm that finds the maximum value

## Nonlinear Models

-   In ML environments, the estimated variance of $\boldsymbol{\hat{\beta}}$ is estimated as the negative of the expected value of the Hessian (information matrix) $$\hat{Var}(\boldsymbol{\hat{\beta}}) = -E[(\frac{\partial^2 lnL}{\partial\boldsymbol{\hat{\beta}} \partial \boldsymbol{\hat{\beta}^{'}}})^{-1}]$$ $$= (\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{f(\mathbf{x_{i}^{'}}\boldsymbol{\hat{\beta}})^2 }{ F(\mathbf{x_{i}^{'}}\boldsymbol{\hat{\beta}})(1- F(\mathbf{x_{i}^{'}}\boldsymbol{\hat{\beta}}) ) }  \mathbf{x_{i}x_{i}^{'}} )^{-1}$$

-   where $F(.)$ is either the Normal or Logistic CDF, and $f(.)$ is the associated PDF

## Nonlinear Models

```{r}
  set.seed(1234)
  n <- 1000
  x <- rnorm(n)
  ystar <- 0.5 + 0.5*x + rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = .7)
  y <- ifelse(ystar > 0, 1, 0)
  dat <- data.frame(y,x)
  
  #Plot the data
  ggplot(dat, aes(x = x, y = y)) + 
    geom_point() + 
    stat_smooth(geom = "line", method="glm", method.args=list(family=binomial(link="logit")), color = "red", size = 1.5, alpha = .5, se = FALSE) +
    stat_smooth(geom = "line",method="glm", method.args=list(family=binomial(link="probit")), color = "blue", size = 1.5, alpha = .5, se = FALSE) +
    theme_pander() +
    annotate("text", x=-2.5, y=.3, label = "Probit", color = "blue") +
    annotate("text", x=-1.8, y=.1, label = "Logit", color = "red") +
    geom_segment(aes(x = -2.5, y = .28, xend = -2.2, yend = .2), color = "blue", arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.25, "cm"))) +
    geom_segment(aes(x = -1.8, y = .13, xend = -1.8, yend = .2), color = "red", arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.25, "cm"))) +
    labs(x = "x", y = "y", title = "Logit and Probit Models") 

```

## Nonlinear Models

### Hypothesis Testing in Probit and Logit

-   Simple tests for coefficient significance is done by the usual $t$-test method

    -   Assume $\boldsymbol{\hat{\beta}}$ has normal distribution (asymptotically)

    -   Test statistic $Z = \frac{\hat{\beta}_{k}}{\hat{SE}(\hat{\beta}_{k})}$

## Nonlinear Models

-   More complicated tests done using one of 3 methods:

    1.  Likelihood Ratio (LR) Test

        -   Test statistic $LR = 2[ln\hat{L}_{U} - ln\hat{L}_{R}]$

        -   $ln\hat{L}_{R}$ is log likelihood evaluated at restricted parameter vector

    2.  Wald (W) Test

        -   Test statistic $W = \hat{g}^{'}[\hat{G}\hat{Var}(\boldsymbol{\hat{\beta}})\hat{G}^{'}]\hat{g}$

        -   $\hat{g}$ is a vector of restrictions evaluated at $\boldsymbol{\hat{\beta}}$

        -   $\hat{G}$ is the derivative of a vector of restrictions evaluated at $\boldsymbol{\hat{\beta}}$

    3.  Lagrange Multiplier (LM) Test

        -   Test statistic $LM = \hat{d}^{'}[\hat{Var}(\boldsymbol{\hat{\beta}})]\hat{d}$

        -   $\hat{d}$ is the derivative of $lnL$ evaluated at restricted $\boldsymbol{\hat{\beta}}$

-   Restrictions can be linear or non-linear

## Nonlinear Models

### Goodness of Fit in Probit and Logit

1.  Confusion Matrix

    |           |     Actual     |                |           |
    |-----------|:--------------:|----------------|-----------|
    | Predicted |       0        | 1              | Total     |
    | 0         |  \# Correct 0  | \# Incorrect 1 | \# Pred 0 |
    | 1         | \# Incorrect 0 | #Correct 1     | \# Pred 1 |
    | Total     |   \# True 0    | \# True 1      |           |

2.  Pseudo-$R^{2}$

    -   McFadden $\rightarrow$ $R^{2} = 1 - \frac{ln\hat{L}_{U}}{ln\hat{L}_{0}}$

        -   $ln\hat{L}_{0}$ is log-likelihood with no explanatory variables

    -   Others are possible, but goodness of fit is not incredibly important

# Limited Dependent Variables

## Introduction

-   Arises when a continuous dependent variable is limited in its range

    -   Censoring

        -   Income is top-coded at some level for privacy

    -   Corner Solutions

        -   Spending on consumer durables limited below by 0

    -   Incidental Truncation

        -   Wage is not observed for people who do not work

-   You can sometimes use OLS depending on context

-   We will cover models for censoring and corner solutions

## Tobit Model

### Latent Variable

-   We again appeal to a latent variable model

$$y^{*} =  \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}w + e$$

-   Suppose the observed $y$ is

$$y = max \{ 0,y^* \}$$

-   This would be the case for things like consumer purchases

    -   You spend zero or some positive amount

    -   It is naturally bounded below by zero

## Tobit Model

-   Because it is either zero or positive, the expected value of $y$ is

$$E[y|w] = E[y|y>0,w]Pr[y>0|w]$$

-   Taking the difference in the observed $y$, we get

$$E[y|w = 1] -  E[y|w = 0]$$ $$= E[y|y>0,w=1]Pr[y>0|w=1] - E[y|y>0,w=0]Pr[y>0|w=0]$$ $$=(Pr[y>0|w=1]-Pr[y>0|w=1]) E[y|y>0,w = 1]$$ $$+ (E[y|y>0,w = 1]  - E[y|y>0,w = 0]) Pr[y>0|w=0]$$

## Tobit Model

-   There are two key pieces

    -   Participation effect

    -   Conditional on Positive effect

-   In terms of potential outcomes

$$E[y|w = 1] -  E[y|w = 0]$$ $$= E[y_1|w = 1] -  E[y_0|w = 0]$$ $$= E[y_1|w = 1] -  E[y_0|w = 1] + E[y_0|w = 1] -  E[y_0|w = 0]$$

-   The limited dependent variable does not change causal interpretation

    -   As long as potential outcome $y_{0}$ is mean independent of treatment

## Tobit Model

### Conditional on Positive

-   In some contexts people run regressions with just the positive outcomes

    -   If you wanted to analyze participation decision separately

-   Difference in observed $y$ for this group is biased if under random assignment

$$E[y|y>0,w = 1] -  E[y|y>0, w = 0]$$ $$= E[y_1|y_1>0] -  E[y_0|y_0>0]$$ $$= E[y_1|y_1>0] - E[y_0|y_1>0] +  E[y_0|y_1>0] -E[y_0|y_0>0]$$

-   The treatment changes who has positive values of potential outcomes

    -   More subtle form of bias

-   You cannot interpret conditional on positive effects as causal

## Tobit Model

### Model

-   This model is used in the context of censoring and corner solutions

-   We have data on a random sample

-   The outcome is limited in its range

-   There is a mass of observations at 1 or more values

    -   Usually zeroes

    -   Sometimes some upper amount, like income

-   Using OLS may be a bad strategy depending on your goals

    -   Can produce predicted values outside the limited range

## Tobit Model

-   The Tobit model starts with the latent variable model

$$y^{*} = \mathbf{x}\boldsymbol{\beta} + e, \text{ where } e \sim N(0,\sigma^2_{e})$$ $$y = \text{max}(0,y^{*})$$

-   The conditional expectation of interest depends on context

    -   Censored data

        -   $E[y^{*}|\mathbf{x}]$

        -   $y^{*}$ usually has meaning when data are censored

    -   Corner Solutions

        -   $E[y|\mathbf{x}]$ and $E[y|y>0, \mathbf{x}]$

        -   $y_{i}^{*}$ usually has no meaning for corner solutions

        -   This is the most common situation

## Tobit Model

### Estimation

-   Estimate this model by maximum likelihood

-   The likelihood function has two pieces

-   When $y_{i} = 0$

$$Pr(y_{i} = 0| \mathbf{x}) = Pr(y_{i}^{*}<0 |\mathbf{x})$$ $$= Pr(\mathbf{x}\boldsymbol{\beta} +e<0 |\mathbf{x})$$

## Tobit Model

-   Due to symmetry in the distribution of $e$

$$= Pr(e>\mathbf{x}\boldsymbol{\beta}  |\mathbf{x})$$ $$= Pr(\frac{e}{\sigma_{e}}>\frac{\mathbf{x}\boldsymbol{\beta}}{\sigma_{e}}  |\mathbf{x})$$

$$= 1-\Phi\left (  \frac{\mathbf{x}\boldsymbol{\beta}}{\sigma_{e}}  \right)$$

## Tobit Model

-   When $y_{i} > 0$

$$f(y_{i} | y_{i}>0, \mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{\sigma_{e}} \phi \left ( \frac{ y_{i} - \mathbf{x}\boldsymbol{\beta}}{\sigma_{e}}    \right )$$

-   Combining terms, we can form the likelihood function

$$\mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\beta}|\mathbf{y}, \mathbf{X}) =\Pi_{y_{i}=0} \left(1-\Phi\left (  \frac{\mathbf{x}\boldsymbol{\beta}}{\sigma_{e}}  \right) \right ) \Pi_{y_{i}>0} \left( \frac{1}{\sigma_{e}} \phi \left ( \frac{ y_{i} - \mathbf{x}\boldsymbol{\beta}}{\sigma_{e}}    \right ) \right)$$

## Tobit Model

-   The log likelihood is

$$ln\mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\beta}|\mathbf{y}, \mathbf{X}) =\sum_{y_{i}=0} ln \left(1-\Phi\left (  \frac{\mathbf{x}\boldsymbol{\beta}}{\sigma_{e}}  \right) \right )  + \sum_{y_{i}>0} ln\left( \frac{1}{\sigma_{e}} \phi \left ( \frac{ y_{i} - \mathbf{x}\boldsymbol{\beta}}{\sigma_{e}}    \right ) \right)$$

-   Maximize this function by choosing the parameter vector $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ and $\sigma_{e}$

## Tobit Model

-   Marginal effects will depend on the context of our estimation

    -   Censored data $$\frac{\partial E[y^{*}|\mathbf{x}]}{\partial x_{k}} = \beta_{k}$$

        -   In a Tobit with censored data, you can interpret the slope directly

    -   Corner Solutions

    -   $\frac{\partial E[y|\mathbf{x}]}{\partial x_{k}} = \Phi(\frac{ \mathbf{x}\boldsymbol{\beta} }{\sigma})\beta_{k}$

    -   $\frac{\partial E[y| y>0,\mathbf{x}]}{\partial x_{k}} = \{1-\lambda(\frac{ \mathbf{x}\boldsymbol{\beta} }{\sigma})[\frac{ \mathbf{x}\boldsymbol{\beta} }{\sigma} + \lambda(\frac{ \mathbf{x}\boldsymbol{\beta} }{\sigma})] \}\beta_{k}$

        -   With corner solutions it depends on what you want

        -   You may want slope for random person, or conditional on $y>0$

## Tobit Model

### Issues with Tobit Model

1.  It must be possible for the dependent variable to take values near the limit

    -   Example: not the case with consumer durables

    -   You either spend zero or a large amount

2.  Intensive and Extensive margins have same parameters

    -   Means the model is relatively inflexible

    -   Can be solved by modelling each separately

3.  Normality assumption

4.  Care must be taken in interpreting the coefficients

    -   Do we care about the effect of $x_{k}$ on $y$ or $y^{*}$?
